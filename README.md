Alpha dreamers Banking consortium is a financial institution that provides business loans, savings accounts, and checking accounts for individuals and businesses. The bank has been experiencing problems with regards to a large number of clients failing to pay back the loans.Measures need to be put in place to reduce the large number of clients failing to pay. As a BI technician I have visualized the data in the CSV file using graphs and tables to be able to understand the data.
